# Headlines

Headlines is a powerful news aggregator that consolidates multiple news sources into one central location, providing you with a constantly updated feed throughout the day. The app offers an efficient way to keep up with the latest articles and news stories, while also allowing you to save articles for later reading.

## Icebox
I have exciting plans to continue improving Headlines. My plans include:

- Adding filters to enable users to narrow down the articles by location, topics, and sources
- Implementing a search bar that will allow users to search through articles by keywords
- Implementing Docker to streamline deployment and improve the app's scalability.
